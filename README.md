# Emis_CaseStudy_Test
Complex Nested Data Processing

Tools Used:

IDE: Intellij

Spark Version: 2.3.1

Programming Language:

Scala Version: 2.11

Note:

1. I saved the data in CSV format after processing it.
   I couldn't push the file into git because it was too large (950 MB), 
   so I choose a parquet file, which is only 16 MB.

2. I didn't containerize my pipeline because I didn't have any expertise with Docker.
   I attempted to do so by searching for relevant material on Google, but I ran into plenty of other problems.

3. I saved the data on the local filesystem after it had been processed.
